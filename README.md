### App Overview

This app aims to keep track of your health indicators such as weight, sleep, average heart rate, calories burnt etc.

This app is built in a modular way. So, new indicators can be easily added just by creating a new Indicator model and adding it to the Constant data of the app. Here, Firebase is used for authentication as well as a backend for storing data. Firebase Analytics has also been implemented to analyse app data via firebase.

### App Structure

The app is structured as follows:

```
/bloc
  /auth
  /firestore
  ... and more
/config
/constant
/models
/presentation
  /common
  /screens
/repository
/utils
```

**bloc** contains the state management layer used for communication between UI and repository. `auth` contains bloc related to authentication such as signin, signup and signout. `firestore` contains bloc related to handling firesore and api calls.

**config** contains common configuration used across the application.

**constant** contains routing information and common constant values such as strings.

**presentation** contains all the UI related code. `common` contains common UI widgets used across multiple screens. `screens` contains code for all different screens.

**repository** contains code for interacting with external servers and other tasks. It contains networking and other third party interactions.
