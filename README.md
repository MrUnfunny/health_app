In HomeScreen, all expenses are visualized in a line chart and crypto specific expenses are shown in line chart in expenses screen. On starting app, it checks whether user is logged in or not and based on it, it shows home screen or main screen showing options to either sign in or sign up with a new account.

**NOTE:** All crypto incomes and expenses are converted to USD by fetching latest price to provide better overview.
